# The Sleeping Barber Problem

## Short Description

There is a barbershop with a number of barber's chairs. When a customer arrives, he sits in an available chair if there is one. If there are no available chairs, he leaves. When the barber finishes with a customer, the customer leaves, and the barber starts working on any customers in waiting. If there are no customers waiting, the barber goes to sleep.
